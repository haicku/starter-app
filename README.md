# starter-app

The focus of this repo is to offer as start point for multipurpose web apps based on login & crud operations over resources.

For a quick start:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/haicku/starter-app
cd starter-app
npm install
npm run server
```

## Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

You will need **git** to clone this repository. You can get git from http://git-scm.com/.

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from http://nodejs.org/.

#### Clone

To get you started you can simply clone `master` branch from the
[haicku/starter-app](https://github.com/haicku/starter-app) repository and install the dependencies:

Clone the starter-app repository using **git**:

```
git clone https://github.com/haicku/starter-app
cd starter-app
```

If you just want to start a new project without the commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/haicku/starter-app <your-desired-folder>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.

In order to support [Progressive Enhancement](pe), you should create a version that is supported in all browsers, that is the purpose for `branch v0`. To clone this branch, you can use:

```bash
git clone --branch=v0 https://github.com/haicku/starter-app <your-desired-folder>
```


#### Install Dependencies

We have two kinds of dependencies in this project: tools and AngularJS framework code.  The tools help
us manage and test the application.

* We get the tools we depend upon via `npm`, the [node package manager](npm).
* We also get the AngularJS and Angular Material library code via `npm`

```
npm install
```

You should find that you have one new folder in your project.

* `node_modules` - contains the npm packages for the tools we need.

## Design principles

Here are some interesting ideas, that you'll find in the code structure:

  - [Progressive Enhacement](pe)
  - [Semantic Web](semantic), rely on browser for view rendering
  - [*T*est *D*riven *D*evelopment](tdd)
  - As many as I've found coherent, from the [johnpapa/angular-styleguide](angular-sg)
